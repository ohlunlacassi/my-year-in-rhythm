# My Year in Rhythm

A personal fitness data visualization project that transforms Mi Fitness data into an engaging visual narrative. The project spans October 2024 through December 2025, visualizing training patterns through an ECG-style heartbeat waveform.

## Features

- **ECG Waveform Visualization**: Daily training intensity displayed as rhythmic heartbeat patterns
- **Multi-Sport Support**: 19+ different activity types, each with unique visual patterns (aerobics, running, yoga, strength training, etc.)
- **Calendar Integration**: Rest periods annotated with life events, grouped by category (study, health, personal)
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover tooltips showing weekly training stats, dropdown sport selector with color-coded activities
- **Smooth Animations**: Dual-pass drawing animation (bright + dim) that continuously loops

## Tech Stack

Built with Svelte and D3.js, featuring scroll-snap navigation, custom exponential easing functions, and turquoise-orange color scheme.
